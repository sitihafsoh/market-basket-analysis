# <h1 align="center"><b>Market Basket Analysis for Online Retail</b></h1>

## Project Overview
This project focuses on a Market Basket Analysis using the "Online Retail II" dataset. This dataset contains transaction data from a UK-based online retailer specializing in unique, all-occasion giftware. The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover relationships between different products sold by the retailer. By identifying which items are frequently purchased together, we can provide actionable insights for business strategies such as product placement, cross-selling campaigns, and personalized recommendations.
