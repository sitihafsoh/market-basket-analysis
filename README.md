# <h1 align="center"><b>Market Basket Analysis for Online Retail</b></h1>

## Project Overview

This project focuses on a Market Basket Analysis using the "Online Retail II" dataset. This dataset contains transaction data from a UK-based online retailer specializing in unique, all-occasion giftware. The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover relationships between different products sold by the retailer. By identifying which items are frequently purchased together, we can provide actionable insights for business strategies such as product placement, cross-selling campaigns, and personalized recommendations.

## Business Question

1. What items are most frequently bought together by our customers?
2. How do buying patterns change across different seasons?
3. Which products should be bundled or cross-promoted to maximize sales revenue?
4. How can we increase the number of items a customer buys in a single transaction?
